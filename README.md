# Image-Detection DL
Deep learnin image detection with CNN on Weather

This project aims to develop an intelligent weather detection system using Deep Learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to automatically classify weather conditions based on images. Weather prediction and classification from visual data can support multiple industries like agriculture, transportation, and disaster management.

The model is trained on a labeled dataset of weather images such as sunny, cloudy, rainy, snowy, etc., and uses deep CNN architecture to learn the visual patterns associated with each weather type. The system can then accurately detect the current weather by analyzing a single image captured by a camera or drone.

Importance of the Project:
📸 Real-time Classification: Automates weather detection from visual data without manual observation.

🌾 Useful in Agriculture: Helps farmers plan irrigation and harvesting based on current weather condition detection.

🚗 Transportation Support: Real-time road weather awareness improves traffic and driving decisions.

🌪️ Disaster Management: Early detection of extreme weather through surveillance images may assist in preventive action.
